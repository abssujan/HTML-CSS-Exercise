## YouTube Demo Site

## Discription

Trying to create a YouTube demo side with HTML & CSS. I chose a tailwind framework to build this site.

I faced some problems to make this site

1. First the fixed position issues.

   ➜ Firstly, when I put a fixed position on the sidebar the flexbox was broken. I don't know why flexbox behaves like that. I searched on google but I can't find the proper answer. Then somehow I fixed the problem now this code running well but I didn't understand why this happens.
2. Scrollbar thumb issue.

   ➜ I didn't make a proper thumb scrollbar I don't know why the height didn't work and there is another thing I don't know how YouTube makes two different scrollbars "I mean the design".
3. Responsive & Design.

   ➜ I tried to make a similar responsive & design like Youtube but there is some limitation with a tailwind which is the reason It's can't happen.
4. Mistakes & Code spaces and blank lines.

    ➜ I mistake the spell at branch name and I don't know how I can change it. I tried writing a fresh code without spaces or blank lines.
